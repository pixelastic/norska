title: Tailwind

In addition to the base [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and its [Typography
plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin), `norska` comes with its
own additions.

## Scale

`norska` uses a custom scale for all dimension-based classes.

The same base scale is used for `width` and `height` (including `min` and `max`)
variants, as well as `margin`, `padding`, `borders` and `absolute` positioning.

The base scale has 20 steps, ranging from `w-1` (`1rem`) to `w-20` (`28rem`).
Values smaller than `1rem` can be achieved with `w-01` through `w-04`. Really
really small values are available with `w-001` and `w-002`.

Percentage values are also accessible with keys ending with `p`. `w-20p` means
`width: 20%`. All multiples of 10 are available, as well as the common `25p`,
`33p`, `66p` and `75p`.

Some width relative to the number of characters in a row are also available:
`25ch`, `50ch`, `65ch`, `75ch` and `100ch`, as well as `prose` set to `65ch`.

To cover the last cases, the following values are also added: `50vh`, `50vw`,
`100vh`, `100vw`, `0`, `none` and `auto`.

## Purging

In production, the resulting CSS file will be _purged_. This means that all
classes that are generated but not used in any HTML file will be removed. This
is a very important step when using Tailwind as otherwise our CSS will be
bloated with thousands of classes we don't use.

Note that by default any custom CSS you added to your `style.css` file will be
kept, no matter if it is present or not in the pages. If you want to purge it as
well, you should wrap it in a `@layer utilities { }` block.

## Plugins

`norska` also cames bundled with its own set of custom Tailwind plugins:
