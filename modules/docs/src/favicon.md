title: Favicon
---

All `norska` websites have their favicon image defined by the theme they use.
Most of them use an emoji embedded in a `favicon.svg` file.

If you want to change the favicon used, you need to create either
a `favicon.png` or `favicon.svg` in your `./src` folder and it will be used in
place of the default one.
